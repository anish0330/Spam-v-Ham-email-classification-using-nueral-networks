# Email classification using Nueral networks.

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of neural networks(RNN, LSTM) for classifying email data. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust email classification system that can accurately categorize emails into predefined classes such as spam or ham.
Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms modeled after the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (or neurons) that can learn from data by adjusting the weights of the connections between nodes. Neural networks are particularly powerful for tasks that involve complex patterns and high-dimensional data, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and, in this case, email classification.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed the latest version of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
## Installation
To install this project, follow these steps:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n custom_env_name
```
This command will create a new Conda environment that includes the dependencies needed for the project.
## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
```bash
conda activate <env_name>
jupyter notebook
```
Replace <env_name> with the name of the Conda environment specified above. This will activate the environment and start Jupyter Notebook, where you can open and run the notebook file.
